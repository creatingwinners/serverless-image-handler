# Solution Overview

The Serverless Image Handler solution helps to embed images on websites and mobile applications to drive user engagement. It uses [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/en/stable/) to provide high-speed image processing without sacrificing image quality. To minimize costs of image optimization, manipulation, and processing, this solution automates version control and provides flexible storage and compute options for file reprocessing.

This solution automatically deploys and configures a serverless architecture optimized for dynamic image manipulation. Images can be rendered and returned spontaneously. For example, an image can be resized based on different screen sizes by adding code on a website that leverages this solution to resize the image before being sent to the screen using the image. It uses [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) for global content delivery and [Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3) (Amazon S3) for reliable and durable cloud storage.

# Architecture Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](./architecture.png)

The AWS CloudFormation template deploys an Amazon CloudFront distribution, Amazon API Gateway REST API, and an AWS Lambda function. Amazon CloudFront provides a caching layer to reduce the cost of image processing and the latency of subsequent image delivery. The Amazon API Gateway provides endpoint resources and triggers the AWS Lambda function. The AWS Lambda function retrieves the image from the customer's Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket and uses Sharp to return a modified version of the image to the API Gateway. Additionally, the solution generates a CloudFront domain name that provides cached access to the image handler API.

# AWS CDK and Solutions Constructs

[AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and [AWS Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create well-architected infrastructure applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework. This solution uses the following AWS Solutions Constructs:

- [aws-cloudfront-s3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-cloudfront-s3.html)
- [aws-cloudfront-apigateway-lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/constructs/aws-cloudfront-apigateway-lambda.html)

In addition to the AWS Solutions Constructs, the solution uses AWS CDK directly to create infrastructure resources.

# Customizing the Solution

## Prerequisites for Customization

- [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- Node.js 14.x or later

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-solutions/serverless-image-handler.git
cd serverless-image-handler
export MAIN_DIRECTORY=$PWD
```

### 2. Declare environment variables

```bash
export REGION=aws-region-code # the AWS region to launch the solution (e.g. us-east-1)
export BUCKET_PREFIX=my-bucket-name # the bucket prefix, randomized name recommended
export BUCKET_NAME=$BUCKET_PREFIX-$REGION # the bucket name where customized code will reside
export SOLUTION_NAME=my-solution-name # the solution name
export VERSION=my-version # version number for the customized code
```

## Unit Test

After making changes, run unit tests to make sure added customization passes the tests:

```bash
cd $MAIN_DIRECTORY/deployment
chmod +x run-unit-tests.sh
./run-unit-tests.sh
```

## Build

```bash
cd $MAIN_DIRECTORY/deployment
chmod +x build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $BUCKET_PREFIX $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION
```

## Deploy

- Deploy the distributable to the Amazon S3 bucket in your account. Make sure you are uploading the files in `deployment/global-s3-assets` and `deployment/regional-s3-assets` to `$BUCKET_NAME/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION`.
- Get the link of the solution template uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket.
- Deploy the solution to your account by launching a new AWS CloudFormation stack using the link of the solution template in Amazon S3.

# Collection of operational metrics

This solution collects anonymous operational metrics to help AWS improve the quality and features of the solution. For more information, including how to disable this capability, please see the [implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/serverless-image-handler/op-metrics.html).

# RIA Play

In your front-end application, you can access both the original and modified images by creating an image request object, stringifying and encoding that object, and appending it to the path of the Amazon CloudFront URL as shown below

```code
https://distributionName.cloudfront.net/base64encodedrequest
```

For the time being only the "resize" functionality will be used. When required this part will be updated explaining how to add additional functionality.

## Resize parameters

Resize image to width, height or width x height.

When both a width and height are provided, the possible methods by which the image should fit these are:

- `cover`: (default) Preserving aspect ratio, ensure the image covers both provided dimensions by cropping/clipping to fit.
- `contain`: Preserving aspect ratio, contain within both provided dimensions using "letterboxing" where necessary.
- `fill`: Ignore the aspect ratio of the input and stretch to both provided dimensions.
- `inside`: Preserving aspect ratio, resize the image to be as large as possible while ensuring its dimensions are less than or equal to both those specified.
- `outside`: Preserving aspect ratio, resize the image to be as small as possible while ensuring its dimensions are greater than or equal to both those specified.

## Example

### Goal

Resize the image `https://d1sw7x4s6hs80l.cloudfront.net/13179/colourful-web-theme-landscape.jpeg`, which demensions are `3840 x 2160 pixels`, to an image with a `width 1280 pixels` while maintaining the original image aspect ratio.

### Solution

1. Get the corresponding S3 Bucket and CloudFront destination
2. Get the bucket key
3. Create image request object
4. Stringify the request object
5. Base64 encode the request object
6. Create final URL

**1: Get the corresponding S3 Bucket**

[CloudFront and S3 Buckets](#cloudfront-and-s3-buckets) and you should come up with the following results:

- S3 Bucket: `riaplay-sgp-dev-source-183pz60thvwzz`
- CF Destination: `d2f1wwz01txa4c.cloudfront.net`

**2: Get the bucket key**

The bucket key can be found by removing the CloudFront URL from the original image URL:

- Bucket key: `13179/colourful-web-theme-landscape.jpeg`

**3: Create image request object**

```json
{
	"bucket": "riaplay-sgp-dev-source-183pz60thvwzz",
	"key": "13179/colourful-web-theme-landscape.jpeg",
	"edits": {
		"resize": {
			"width": 1280,
			"fit": "inside"
		}
	}
}
```

**4: Stringify the request object**

Speaks for itself. In JS would be something like:

```js
const str = JSON.stringfy(obj);
```

**5: Base64 encode the request object**

Speaks for itself. In JS would be sometimg like:

```js
const enc = Buffer.from(str).toString("base64");
```

**6: Create final URL**

```js
"https://d2f1wwz01txa4c.cloudfront.net/" + enc;
```

You should have ended up with the following URL:

```
https://d2f1wwz01txa4c.cloudfront.net/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJyaWFwbGF5LXNncC1kZXYtc291cmNlLTE4M3B6NjB0aHZ3enoiLCJrZXkiOiIxMzE3OS9jb2xvdXJmdWwtd2ViLXRoZW1lLWxhbmRzY2FwZS5qcGVnIiwiZWRpdHMiOnsicmVzaXplIjp7IndpZHRoIjoxMjgwLCJmaXQiOiJpbnNpZGUifX19
```
